# Homeserver Services
_A collection of docker compose yaml files used to setup my home server and its various services._

## About
These `compose.yaml` files and their associated sub yaml files are designed in a way to:

a) Allow one to pick and choose which services to deploy with a simple `#`

b) Keep the files sane to work with by splitting each service into its own file

The compose files can be found in their associated category folders.
